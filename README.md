# Lambda DynamoDB REST API Demo

This project is trying to build a tiny but complete and production-ready lambda REST API service with serverless framework. The goal is to build every feature with best practices.

## Usage Instructions

### Install packages

Run `npm i` or `yarn` to install the packages

### Testing

### Deploy
